## As a Person
I am a class of 2023 student majoring in ***Computer Science*** and considering minoring in **Design**. I was born and raised in *Orange County, California*. In my free time, I love to cook pasta, go on hikes to beautiful views, and watch sunsets at the beach ~~or on mountains~~. My favorite quote that I strive to live by is:
> Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. **Be _kind_.** Always.
